              <p>Each one of them is precious beyond belief and unique in their own ways.</p>

              <p>Evelyn Allen (aka Ev, Evvers, Evvy, Evs, The Evster, Ev-monster) is one of our precious pots of gold; a
                true gift from God to the world. She is loving, determined, independent, funny, intelligent, beautiful,
                and very much in charge.</p>

              <p>Late in her 4th year, Evy began complaining of pain in her hips. Weeks passed as doctors worked to
                determine the source, while all the while the pain continued to increase and Evvy’s mobility decreased.
                On
                March 26th, it was determined that Evvy had stage 4 Neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma is a fairly rare form
                of
                cancer with about 800 cases diagnosed in US children each year. This cancer typically begins in the
                adrenal glands with the high risk, stage 4 designation meaning that her cancer has spread. In our Evy’s
                case, they found the main tumor in her right adrenal gland with additional tumors along herv spine. The
                cancer was also found in her bone marrow. This was devastating news that caused tears to flow easily;
                fear
                for the future and what it might hold; and the overwhelming question of “why.”</p>

              <p>During the next couple of weeks, the medical team and the support team (Team Evvy) were assembled and
                put
                their plans in place. The treatment plan was to last a grueling 18+ months and would involve six rounds
                of
                chemotherapy with approximately 3 weeks in between each round; bone marrow and stem cell extraction;
                surgery to remove the tumors; reimplantation of bone marrow and stem cells; radiation; and immunotherapy
                to name just a portion of what the future held. The support team plan was also extensive and included
                everything from care for Ben (and Macy) to logistics; from work schedule modifications to food and
                funding. All of these were important considerations but the main focus of “Team Evvy” was to ensure that
                Evelyn, Benjamin, Stephanie and Dustin were thoroughly supported and would not walk this unwanted part
                of
                their journeys alone.</p>

              <p>5 months have now passed since the Neuroblastoma diagnosis and great progress has been made both
                medically
                and mentally. The doctors are reporting that the plan is going well and are pleased so far with the
                results.</p>

              <p>We are so proud of Evvs and how she has handled herself and has braved the examinations, scans, tests,
                transfusions, 6 rounds of Chemo, surgery, long stays in the hospital, ups, downs, hair and weight loss,
                and pain. What once was a scared, small child keeping an eye on the hospital door wondering what the
                next
                nurse or doctor who passes through it might do to her, has now blossomed into a near-model patient. She
                confidently struts into the Starfish ward on the 10th floor at Doernbecker children’s hospital and owns
                the hearts of the Staff. She now takes and active role assisting with her own care; wears her
                hearts/American flag inspired back brace faithfully; and helps Mom and Dad keep her Hickman Port (her
                surgically implanted “tubies”) safe and clean. She has shown great endurance and fortitude and is very
                inspirational.</p>


              <p>We are also proud of Stephanie, Dustin and Benjamin. Their happy lives filled with their daily routines
                and family outings were turned upside down on March 26th, 2019 and have been drastically altered ever
                since. They have all sacrificed and done everything necessary to ensure Evs’ treatment stays on track
                including learning all they can about this disease; questioning if the plan can be improved; countless
                trips and stays at the hospital; giving shots and medication; monitoring Evvy’s vitals closely; and
                altering work schedules. This type of situation can change people forever and sometimes the choice comes
                down to sink or swim. They have all elected to swim and have shown great growth as individuals, and as a
                family.</p>

              <p>And you should all know we are “very” thankful for all the people who have offered support. In fact,
                there
                has been an absolute outpouring of support of all kinds. “Team Evvy” has swelled from a troop of family
                and close friends to an army; many of whom do not even know her. We can’t begin to mention everyone, so
                we
                won’t attempt to. But please be assured that you are appreciated, and your acts of kindness and
                generosity
                will not be forgotten.</p>

              <p>These acts have come in many forms including prayers; phone calls; visits; letters; donations of meals,
                funds and gift cards; morale support and being there; chores; work vacation donations; gifts for Evy;
                advice; sharing your own experiences; and skilled medical expertise and care. You have all helped to
                provide Evelyn, Stephanie, Dustin and Benjamin with faith, hope and love for the journey forward. Thank
                you from the bottom of our hearts.</p>

              <p>Thankful and Blessed Grandparents</p>
